Data and scripts for generating the NACA0012 pitching case.

Run "./wiggle" to generate the pitching section of the input file and combine with the top and bottom portions.  The result will be a.yaml.

To generate the mesh:
Within the mesh directory, run "./makebrick" to generate the outer cartesian portion of the grid.
Then run "./runpw" to generate the inner ogrid portion with pointwise, and join it to the cartesian portion.

To run the case, submit the "run" script using slurm.

The "flowconditions.py" script does some arithmetic to help set up the case.
